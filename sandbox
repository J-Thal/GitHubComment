                    <h2>How I got my squad built to start off</h2>
                    <p><strong>S</strong>o I got Madden 22 for Christmas along with a $50 card.
                        However I didn't use all of it on this game because I got NHL 22 as well. The dumb part was that
                        I
                        only used $18 instaed of the whole thing. So I started off at an 88 Overall because of buying
                        the
                        competitive pack that would give me a squad for both sides of the ball. It gave me some good
                        players
                        such as Michael Vick, Luke Kuechly, Troy Polamalu, and more. This team turned out pretty good
                        for
                        the 1 month process. However, this team still needs builing on offense. As the Tony Romo and the
                        Offensive Line needs to be replaced for better protection along with better accuracy on throws.
                    </p>
                </blockquote>
                <h2>How I got my Quarterback</h2>
                <blockquote>
                    <p> Tony Romo has an ability that gives his receivers extra routes called <em>Hot Route Master</em>,
                        what's so good about this ability is that it gives the receiver 4 extra hot routes to make the
                        play
                        better to your benefit. So it gives you more options to choose from.
                        With that being said, there is a better Quarterback that I'm trying to get. Which is the 96
                        Overall Justin Herbert.
                        Where I would put 3 abilities that contains 9 abitity points. The first one was quickdraw, which
                        contains 1 ability point
                        and what it does is it gives the QB a quicker release when under pressure. The next ability is
                        Gunslinger which is 6
                        abiltiy points. This as well helps with a quick release but gives the QB a stronger and faster
                        throw. This is considered to be the best ability in the game right now. And lastly, the most
                        important part, hot route master. Which is what I had when I had Romo as my QB.</p>
                </blockquote>
                <h2>My offense to a 94 Overall</h2>
                <blockquote>
                    <p>Since you already know who my Quarterback is, lemme start off with how I built the running back
                        lineup. I needed a receiving back and a power back. Deebo Samuel with a grab and go ability was
                        literally the best option to pick from since I got him for free. I got him by winning 25 games
                        on house rules mode on the second update on it. That was after I got my Left Tackle, Taylor
                        Lewan, by winning only 10 games on house rules. This took me 35 wins in total on the process.
                        But only took 2 days in the process. Also I had to get a decent powerback for goalline and
                        inside runs. Najee Harris is a great powerback that is fast for his overall rating, 92, and does
                        me great service scoring touchdowns from the goalline. Wide receivers on the other hand I made
                        sure I had a balance. Calvin Johnson, A tall fast wide reciever, Jerry Jeudy, a route runner,
                        Terry McLaurin, a deep threat, make the perfect combo to give me that balance as well as speed
                        and acceleration. Also having a Tight end in my scheme is a must, as I have an Out-of-Position,
                        94 Overall, Robert Woods, to get me some speed on a couple more plays I love to run, who I got
                        in a set to get my Tight End. To the rest of my Offensive Line, they all do the job. I seriously
                        can't remember the last time I got sacked or even have a tackle for a loss.</p>

                <blockquote>
                    <h2>My defense to a 96 Overall</h2>
                    <p>The front line says it all on the defense as the best player on my team is my Left End as a 99
                        Overall with my Run Stuff and Mind Reader strategy cards that also go to the rest of the team.
                        Cameron Jordan is the best run stopper in the game who can also sack the Quarterback. Along with
                        97 Overall Mario Williams who is a giant at Right End standing at 6'6, 292 lbs with 89 Speed as
                        a Defensive End. At Defensive Tackle who I got for free from the Gridiron Forge, D.J. Reader is
                        a great Defensive Tackle to have for free that could save me coins and do good service for me.
                        My secondary is another key part of my defense. </p>
